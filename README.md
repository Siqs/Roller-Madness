# Roller-Madness

A game developed in Unity3D as an assignment for the Introduction to Game Development available on Coursera by Michigan State University.

You use the WASD keys to move around the map, but be careful: the boxes will chase you while you collect the coins and will only stop when hitting each other or falling to their death.
